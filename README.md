# Home-SIEM-Lab
A Home SIEM Lab with Elastic on Kali Linux uses the Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, and Beats) to collect, process, and visualize security logs. It helps monitor network traffic, detect threats, and practice incident response in a safe, controlled environment, offering hands-on experience in log analysis and SIEM management.
