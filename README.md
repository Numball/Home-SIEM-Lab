# Home-SIEM-Lab
A Home SIEM Lab with Elastic on Kali Linux uses the Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, and Beats) to collect, process, and visualize security logs. It helps monitor network traffic, detect threats, and practice incident response in a safe, controlled environment, offering hands-on experience in log analysis and SIEM management.


## Objective

The objective of this project is to build a practical Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) lab to gain hands-on experience in security analysis.

### Skills Learned

- SIEM Configuration: Understanding how to set up and configure a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system.
- Log Management: Learning to collect, analyze, and visualize logs for security events.
- Security Event Generation: Using tools like nmap to create and simulate security events for analysis.
- Alerting Mechanisms: Creating and tuning alerts to detect specific security incidents.
- Data Visualization: Developing dashboards to visualize security telemetry and metrics.


### Tools Used

- Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana): For log management, analysis, and visualization.
- Elastic Agent: For collecting logs and telemetry from the Kali machine.
- Kali Linux: As the platform for generating security events and testing.
